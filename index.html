			<h1>"Lip, Dip, Paint"</h1>
			<p>It is important to remember, especially in an era of stringent health and safety in the workplace, that the labor safety laws that keep us safe were built on the blood sacrifice of those that came before us.</p>
			<p>The Radium Girls were instrumental in laying the foundation for our current health and safety laws in the workplace. In the 1920s, 4,000 female employees worked at three factories in the United States that used radioactive paint to paint watch dials. The radium would make the watch faces glow in the dark, and had to be applied using fine camel hair brushes.</p>
			<p>Assured by their employers that the paint was safe, the women were instructed to "lip, dip, paint," licking the tips of their brushes to ensure a fine point before each brush stroke. This lead to each of them ingesting great quantities of radioactive radium.</p>
			<hr>
			<h1>Consequences and Cover-up</h1>
			<p>In time, many of the women developed anemia, necrosis of the jaw (now known as "radium jaw," and began to quickly deteriorate and die. The women, realizing that the companies had betrayed them, attempted to get compensation from their employers.</p>
			<p>The watch dial companies attempted to silence the women, starting campaigns of disinformation, preventing their doctors and dentists from releasing information, giving (in at least one case) fake medical examinations, and claiming the symptoms of the women were caused by syphilis in order to smear their reputations.</p>
			<p>Five factory workers -- Grace Fryer, Edna Hussman, Katherine Schaub, and sisters Quinta McDonald, and Albina Larice, known as the Radium Girls -- brought a lawsuit against their employers. By the time the women were able to be seen in court, none were strong enough to raise their hands to take an oath. The lawsuit went as far as the Supreme Court, having been won eight times over before the company was forced to pay compensation.</p>

			<h1>An Enduring Legacy</h1>
			<p>The efforts of the Radium Girls set the precident in the United States for our current labour safety standards, and held employers accountable for the health of their workers.</p>
